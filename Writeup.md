VulnLawyers - CTF Walkthrough

üìÅ Repository Overview

  This repository contains a full walkthrough of the VulnLawyers CTF, solved using only:

  ffuf (directory and subdomain fuzzing)

  Caido (web proxy analysis)

  The methodology follows a clean, repeatable pentest format with all flags captured and documented.

  All screenshots and proof-of-work are stored in the _/screenshots_ directory.

üîß Tools Used

  ffuf ‚Äì Fast web fuzzer

  Caido ‚Äì Web proxy for intercepting and manipulating requests

  Linux shell (Parrot OS)

üîç Scope

    https://sufrin.ctfi/

üß† Objective

  Gain access to the VulnLawyers web server, enumerate for vulnerabilities, escalate privileges, and capture all flags.

üõ∞Ô∏è 1. Recon

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: No ports were open for full nmap scan; proceeded directly to web-based fuzzing using known open access.

üìÇ 2. Directory Fuzzing with ffuf (Main Domain)

  _ffuf -w subdomains.txt -u https://sufrin.ctfi/FUZZ_

  Key results:

    /css
    /images
    /login

üåê 3. Subdomain Discovery with ffuf (Main Domain)

  _ffuf -w subdomains.txt -u https://sufrin.ctfi/ -H "Host: FUZZ.sufrin.ctfi"_

üìå Lessons Learned

Efficient use of just 2 tools (ffuf, caido) is enough to fully compromise a box

Importance of analyzing requests carefully in Caido

Logic flaws and poorly implemented login mechanisms are often more exploitable than buffer overflows
